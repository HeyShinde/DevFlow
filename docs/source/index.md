# Introduction

## What is DevFlow?

**DevFlow** is an AI-powered contextual assistant for developers, designed to supercharge your workflow inside Visual Studio Code. It enables you to search, understand, and manage your codebase using natural language, advanced code analysis, and repository insightsâ€”all from a modern, interactive sidebar UI.

DevFlow consists of a VS Code extension (frontend) and a Python backend server. The extension provides a seamless user interface, while the backend handles code indexing, embeddings, and AI-powered responses.

- **VS Code Extension**: Provides the sidebar UI, commands, and manages backend lifecycle.
- **Sidebar UI**: Interactive webview for search, answers, repo management, and settings.
- **Backend (Python)**: Handles code parsing, indexing, embeddings, and serves AI-powered responses via REST API.
- **Communication**: The extension communicates with the backend over HTTP, sending user queries and receiving results.
